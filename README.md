# GitHub Hands-On Assignment

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to provide hands-on experience with cloning, forking, managing branches, handling conflicts, GitHub Pages, and exploring open-source contributions.

## Requirements
- A GitHub account (create one if you don't have it already)
- Git installed on your local machine
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)

## Task 1: Cloning and Forking
### Cloning a Repository
1. Chose a public GitHub repository of interest (e.g., a project related to your field of study).
2. Cloned the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
3. Explored the repository's structure, files, and history.

### Forking a Repository
1. Forked the same repository you cloned in Task 1 to your GitHub account.
2. Cloned the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <forked-repository-url>
   ```

## Task 2: Managing Branches
### Creating and Switching Branches
1. In your local repository, created a new branch (e.g., `feature-update`) using the following command:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature-update
   ```
2. Switched to the newly created branch.

### Making Changes and Committing
1. Made changes to a file or added a new file.
2. Committed the changes to the branch using the following commands:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement feature update"
   ```

### Merging Changes
1. Switched back to the main branch using the command:
   ```
   git checkout main
   ```
2. Merged the changes from the `feature-update` branch into the main branch using the following command:
   ```
   git merge feature-update
   ```

## Task 3: Handling Conflicts
### Creating Conflicts
1. In your forked repository, made changes to the same file that you modified in Task 4.
2. Committed the changes.

### Resolving Conflicts
1. Created a new branch to resolve the conflict using the command:
   ```
   git checkout -b conflict-resolution
   ```
2. Resolved the conflict manually in the file.
3. Committed the changes and merged the `conflict-resolution` branch back into `main` using the following commands:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve conflict"
   git checkout main
   git merge conflict-resolution
   ```

## Task 4: GitHub Pages
### Enabling GitHub Pages
1. In your forked repository, created a simple HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).
2. Enabled GitHub Pages for the repository and set the source branch to `main` in the repository settings.

### Accessing the Published Page
1. Visited the GitHub Pages URL for your repository and verified that the HTML file was accessible online.

## Task 5: Open Source Exploration
### Exploring Open Source Projects
1. Searched for an open-source project on GitHub related to your interests.
2. Explored the project's documentation, issues, and contribution guidelines.

### Opening an Issue
1. Opened a new issue in the chosen open-source project, suggesting an improvement, reporting a bug, or asking for clarification.

## Submission
- Pushed all changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
- Shared the link to your forked repository and mentioned the open-source project you explored with the instructor or submitted it as per the class instructions.

## Challenges Faced
1. One challenge you faced was resolving the conflict when merging the `conflict-resolution` branch back into `main`. You had to carefully review the changes and manually edit the file to preserve the desired modifications.
2. Another challenge was ensuring that your issue followed the project's contribution guidelines, as some projects have specific formatting or template requirements for new issues.

## Additional Notes
- You documented the process, commands used, and any challenges faced in this README file.
- If you encountered any other issues, you referred to the GitHub documentation or sought assistance from peers or the instructor.
